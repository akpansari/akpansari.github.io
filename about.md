I am a passionate Software Evangelist with a track record for community building. 
I have a strong understanding of cloud computing technologies and emerging trends in the technology industry. I have always been interested in navigating new channel, as well as approaches to customer acquisition. 

In my current role in Zoho, I work closely with the Product Managers to figure out what to build and relay feedback on how the market reacts to new product/feature launches. 

I am comfortable presenting to an audience and working side by side with application developers while coordinating activities with teams of diverse internal and external stakeholders.

I believe that if we know something, we should publish it on the web for the other people to learn from.
